👋 Hi, I'm **@dmelim**, a passionate Full-Stack Developer working remotely.

💻 I specialize in modern web development with **Go, JavaScript, TypeScript**, and **React**—currently building advanced tools using **React**, **Next.js**, and custom UI components.

📊 With a background in **data analysis**, I enjoy merging backend logic with meaningful insights.

🔐 I'm also exploring **cybersecurity**, having completed the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.

📽️ I run [**Digital Dimension**](https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDimension7) on YouTube, where I break down coding concepts and build fun, creative tech projects to help others level up.

🧪 Currently working through my personal project backlog (and graveyard 👻).

🤝 Open to collaborating on **open-source projects**—especially with **JavaScript**, **Go**, or **Python**. Simple ideas welcome!
