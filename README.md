👋 Hi, I'm @dmelim, a passionate Full-Stack Developer working remotely.

👀 I am keenly interested in Web Development technologies, particularly GO, JavaScript, Typescript, and React.

🌱 Currently, I'm on a learning journey into Rust.

📈 I'm also proficient in data analysis. 

🤝 I'm eager to collaborate on open-source projects involving JavaScript, Python, or Go, but I'm also open to simple projects as a starting point.

📫 Feel free to contact me at dmpmelim@gmail.com for any inquiries or potential collaborations.

💼 I'm currently employed at a company where I work with Python, Go, JS, and TS. Additionally, I'm actively engaged in a React project.

🔒 In my spare time, I'm exploring Cybersecurity, and want to dive into bug bounty. I completed my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

Let's connect and build amazing things together!
